On a fine Saturday morning, as usual I visited my club, opened my laptop. Logged in to Github. Went through a login screen. All fine till now and bam! A huge banner appeared on my screen.

What about my projects? Some of them are hosted on packagist and npm, integrated into the pipeline of some private organization projects I work on ? What seems puzzling to me is the fact that I have, to the best of my knowledge, not undertaken any bot-ish activity, rather than the fact that I logged in behind a big NATted network with hundreds (more or less) active Github users. So unless that one in a zillion zillion chance happened that all hundred users started a git push at the same time… I should be not worried. But Github is enterprise ready ? Isn’t? So there must be something else.

 ~~All my public links to Github return 404 for everyone except me.~~
Now they are all back. 

And as per HN and npm, my listings at NPM should not be affected. Thankfully, no new deployments occurred at our organization.

Update: I wrote to GitHub support and they restored my account within few hours. I still have no idea why I was flagged!
