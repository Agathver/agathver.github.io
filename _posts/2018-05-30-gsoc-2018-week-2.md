_This is Status Report for Fedora App filled by participants on a weekly basis._

## Status Report for Amitosh Swain Mahapatra (amitosh)

- **Fedora Account**: amitosh
- **IRC**: amitosh (found in #fedora, #fedora-dotnet, #fedora-summer-coding, #fedora-commops)
- **Fedora Wiki User Page**: [amitosh](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Amitosh)

This time, I am working on [improving the Fedora Community App]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-04-29-summer-code-and-fedora %}) with the Fedora project. It's been a week since we [started off our coding on may 14]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-05-14-gsoc-2018-kicking-off-the-coding %}).

The [Fedora App](https://pagure.io/Fedora-app) is a central location for Fedora users and innovators to stay updated on The Fedora Project. News updates, social posts, Ask Fedora, as well as articles from Fedora Magazine are all held under this app.

## Tasks Completed

Here is the summary of my work in the second week:

We now have offline capablilties in the app ([#62](https://pagure.io/Fedora-app/issue/62)). The app now caches the content from Fedora Magazine, FedoCal and Fedora Social. Every time we load the app, we refersh the cache from the API end points in the background. We no longer block the user from interacting with the app and the content also loads a lot faster.
([#61](https://pagure.io/Fedora-app/pull-request/61))

It still has some rough edges, we will be addressing them in the following weeks.

<small>[Two Hard Things from Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html)</small>

And in particularly JS, we shall modify it to:

> There are only two hard things in Computer Science:
> 1> Cache invalidation<br />
> 3> Async callbacks<br />
> 2> Naming things.<br />

And fortunately, RxJS provides an elegant solution to (3).

This week was particularly challenging and exciting. RxJS Observables and reactive programming patterns was really interesting to learn. [Learn RxJS](https://www.learnrxjs.io/) by [@btroncone](https://twitter.com/BTroncone) was a great resource that helped me to quickly grasp the concepts. Many thanks!

## What's next ?

I'm working on creating unit tests for various services we use in our app and the integration tests for the different screens.
