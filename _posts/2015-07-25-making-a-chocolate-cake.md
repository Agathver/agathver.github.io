Last weekend I went around the kitchen with a plan of making something new. My friend has been telling to try making a cake and finally I thought it is the time. I went on to make a cake — chocolate cake. Yes I like chocolate very much! I haven’t prepared a cake before. It was going to be a new experience for me, and I was excited!I asked mama for the recipe, did a bit googling and finally found a easy one here .

Here is what I used – bit less than what shown at the recepie. I was making it for myself.

 * 1 cup white wheat flour
 * 1/2 cup sugar
 * 1/2 teaspoon salt
 * 1 teaspoon full baking soda
 * 2 tablespoons cocoa powder
 * 1 tablespoon vinegar
 * 5 tablespoons oil
 * 1 teaspoon vanilla essence
 * 1 cup water

It was a Monday and I refrain from non-veg items on Mondays – so, no eggs.

I mixed the flour,sugar,baking powder and cocoa powder thoroughly in a bowl and kept it aside. Then, in another bowl I took the  vinegar, oil, vanilla and water and stirred them together to make a nearly homogenous mixture. Then I added a dry ingredients to it to make the batter.

Then I poured the batter to a floured round pan and placed it inside the at 180° C for 30 minutes. I took my phone, set the timer. With Linkin Park  on the play list, I was waiting eagerly.

Finally the moment came. The smell was yummy. I didn’t have much for frosting and decoration. It was well baked, just a little less on sugar. And that was my first cake!
